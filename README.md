## Introduction

This bot utilizes the Discord API to interact with users, manage messages, handle interactions, and more. It includes features like message reactions inquiry, message clearing, sending replies with embeds, and responding to slash commands.

## Setup

### Environment Variables

To use this bot, make sure to provide your Discord bot token. Store it in a `.env` file as follows:

```plaintext
TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
```

### Import Dependencies

Import the required dependencies and initialize your Discord bot.

```javascript
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();
import Message from '../discordjs/Client/Message';
import Interactions from "../discordjs/Client/Interactions/interactions";
import Discord from "../discordjs";

const TOKEN = process.env.TOKEN;
const discord = new Discord(TOKEN);
```

## Discord Bot Initialization

Initialize the Discord bot by setting up event listeners and connecting to the WebSocket gateway.

```javascript
// Listen for Message_Create events
discord.listen("Message_Create", async (message) => {
    // ... message event handling ...
});

// Listen for Interaction_Create events
discord.listen("Interaction_Create", async (interaction) => {
    // ... interaction event handling ...
});

// Initialize presence and register slash command
discord.FC(async () => {
    // ... presence setup and slash command registration ...
});

// Connect to Discord WebSocket gateway
discord.connect((client) => {
    console.log(`${client.username} Online`);
});
```

## Message Management

### Reactions Inquiry

Inquire about reactions on messages:

```javascript
discord.listen("Message_Create", async (message) => {
    if (message.content === 'reactions') {
        // ... inquire about reactions ...
    }
});
```

### Message Clear

Clear messages with a command:

```javascript
discord.listen("Message_Create", async (message) => {
    if (message.content.startsWith("!clear")) {
        // ... clear messages ...
    }
});
```

### Reply and Embed

Reply to messages and send embeds:

```javascript
discord.listen("Message_Create", (message) => {
    if (message.content === "212") {
        // ... reply and send embed ...
    }
});
```

## Interaction Handling

Handle interactions from slash commands:

```javascript
discord.listen("Interaction_Create", async (interaction) => {
    if (interaction.data.name == "help") {
        // ... handle interaction response ...
    }
});
```

## Client Function (FC)

The `FC` function sets up the bot's presence and registers slash commands:

```javascript
discord.FC(async () => {
    // ... presence setup and slash command registration ...
});
```

## Bot Connection

Connect your bot to the Discord WebSocket gateway:

```javascript
discord.connect((client) => {
    console.log(`${client.username} Online`);
});
```

## Conclusion

2. Send a response to an interaction using the `send(data: InteractionResponse)` method:

```typescript
const response = { type: 4, data: { content: "Interaction response!" } };
interactions.send(response);
```

### Example

```typescript
import { Constants } from "../../constants";
import { InteractionInfo, InteractionResponse } from "../../@types/datatypes";
import Channel from "../channel";
import WebSocket from 'ws';
import Guild from "../guild";

export default class Interactions implements InteractionInfo {
    // ... class code ...

    constructor(token: string, data: InteractionInfo, webSocket: WebSocket) {
        // ... constructor code ...
    }

    public send(data: InteractionResponse) {
        // ... method code ...
    }
}
```
